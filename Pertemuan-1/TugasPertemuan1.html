      <h1>Defeated</h1>
      <p>When the last fight is lost, the last sword broken;<br>
        The last call sounded, the last order spoken;<br>
        When from the field where braver hearts lie sleeping,<br>
        Faint, and athirst, and blinded, I come creeping,<br>
        With not one waving shred of palm to bring you,<br>
        With not one splendid battle-song to sing you,<br>
        O Love, in my dishonor and defeat,<br>
        Your measureless compassion will be sweet.<br>
      </p>

      <h1>Poem</h1>
      <p>The night is beautiful,<br>
        So the faces of my people.<br>
        The stars are beautiful,<br>
        So the eyes of my people.<br>
        Beautiful, also, is the sun<br>
        Beautiful, also, are the souls of my people.<br>
      </p>

      <h1>A Lady Dressed By Youth</h1>
      <p>Her hair was curls of Pleasure and Delight,<br>
        Which on her brow did cast a glistening light.<br>
        As lace her bashful eyelids downward hung:<br>
        A modest countenance o'er her face was flung:<br>
        Blushes, as coral beads, she strung to wear<br>
        About her neck, and pendants for each ear:<br>
        Her gown was by Proportion cut and made,<br>
        With veins embroidered, with complexion laid,<br>
        Rich jewels of pure honor she did wear,<br>
        By noble actions brightened everywhere:<br>
        Thus dressed, to Fame's great court straightways she went,<br>
        To dance a brawl with Youth, Love, Mirth, Content.<br>
      </p>

      <h1>To an Icicle</h1>
      <p>Chilled into a serenity<br>
        As rigid as your pose<br>
        You linger trustingly,<br>
        But a gutter waits for you.<br>
        Your elegance does not secure<br>
        You favors with the sun.<br>
        He is not one to pity fragileness.<br>
        He thinks all cheeks should burn<br>
        And feel how tears can run.<br>
      </p>

      <h1>The Heart of a Woman</h1>
      <p>The heart of a woman goes forth with the dawn,<br>
        As a lone bird, soft winging, so restlessly on,<br>
        Afar o'er life's turrets and vales does it roam<br>
        In the wake of those echoes the heart calls home.<br>
        The heart of a woman falls back with the night,<br>
        And enters some alien cage in its plight,<br>
        And tries to forget it has dreamed of the stars<br>
        While it breaks, breaks, breaks on the sheltering bars.<br>
      </p>
